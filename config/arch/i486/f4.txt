<09F407>*   memtest.

Type 0fmemtest07 to start a full memory test
No error should appear.

In case of memtest crash or memory error, beware to disable usb legacy support
in bios before running test again. Some buggy bios forget to declare usage of
that memory range. Next try with only one module (or one pair if needed)
